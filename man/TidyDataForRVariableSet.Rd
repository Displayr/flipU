\title{Ensure that variables being returned to Displayr are
as small as they can be.}
\usage{
TidyDataForRVariableSet(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector, matrix, data frame, or list
containing variables that are to be added to a
Displayr Data Set.}
}
\description{
Given a vector, matrix or data frame containing variables
which are to be added to a Data Set in Displayr,
remove any unecessary attributes that would cause
the variables to be larger (in bytes) than they
need to be. Variable attributes are not accessible
once the variable has been added to a data set. The
only exception is attributes for factors, which
should be kept. If input is a data frame, return
it as a list, since data frames must have row names
that do not need to be kept.
