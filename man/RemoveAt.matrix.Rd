\usage{
\method{RemoveAt}{matrix}(x, at = NULL, MARGIN = NULL,
  ignore.case = TRUE, split = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The object from which the elements are to be removed.}

\item{at}{A \code{\link{vector}} or indicating which elements are to be removed.
When \code{at} is \code{\link{character}} elements with this name are removed. When \code{at}
is \code{\link{integer}}, elements with this position are removed. If \code{MARGIN} contains two
or more values, \code{at} may be a list, where each element of the list contains a vector.}

\item{MARGIN}{An \code{\link{vector}} of integers giving the dimensions from which elements should be removed.}

\item{ignore.case}{Ignores case if and when removing elements based on their names.}

\item{split}{Character delimiter to split \code{at} when \code{at} is a
\code{\link{character}}. Default is NULL which means that no splitting
occurs. See \code{\link{strsplit}}.}
}
\value{
An object of the same class as \code{x}.
}
\description{
Removes one or more elements from an object. Dimensions are never
If all elements are removed from a vector, then a 0-length vector is returned.
